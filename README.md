##WORK IN PROGRESS
Currently capable of playing a game of chess with pseudo-legal moves (castling and checks not implemented).
Next steps include:
1. Implementing castling
2. Adding the duck
3. Detecting when the game is over (checkmate, stalemate, 50-move rule, threefold repetition)
Then of course building the engine, so evaluation and search functions.
